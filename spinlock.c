/* The retry strategy is as follows:
   - We test and set the spinlock MAX_SPIN_COUNT times, calling
     sched_yield() each time.  This gives ample opportunity for other
     threads with priority >= our priority to make progress and
     release the spinlock.
   - If a thread with priority < our priority owns the spinlock,
     calling sched_yield() repeatedly is useless, since we're preventing
     the owning thread from making progress and releasing the spinlock.
     So, after MAX_SPIN_LOCK attemps, we suspend the calling thread
     using nanosleep().  This again should give time to the owning thread
     for releasing the spinlock.
     Notice that the nanosleep() interval must not be too small,
     since the kernel does busy-waiting for short intervals in a realtime
     process (!).  The smallest duration that guarantees thread
     suspension is currently 2ms.
   - When nanosleep() returns, we try again, doing MAX_SPIN_COUNT
     sched_yield(), then sleeping again if needed.
